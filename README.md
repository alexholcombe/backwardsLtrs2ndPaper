Should probably get serious about analyzing both E1 and E2 in the same Rmd files so can write the paper.

Subjects AA through AE run ok, aside from several 
"Error in eigen(nhatend) : infinite or missing values in 'x'" 

## Questions for Chris

What's the difference between E2/RunStudy/handednessQoutientsE2 and E2/Data/HandednessData/handednessQuotientsP2E2.xlsx

Why are there 5 folders for E1/doInferentialStats_files ?
