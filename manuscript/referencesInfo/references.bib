	abstract = {This chapter will provide an overview of serial-attention models of eye-movement control in reading, which share the core assumptions that attention is allocated sequentially to support the lexical processing of only one word at a time, and that lexical processing normally causes the eyes to move from one word to the next. Two such models (Reader: Just and Carpenter, 1980; EMMA: Salvucci, 2001) are briefly described and a third (E-Z Reader: Reichle et al., 1998) is described in detail. The chapter then reviews simulations completed using the E-Z Reader model to evaluate the plausibility and generality of its assumptions, and to examine various reading phenomena. These simulations are consistent with the hypothesis that attention is allocated serially during reading.},

	abstract = {How does temporal selection work, and along what dimensions does it vary from one instance to the next? We explored these questions using a phenomenon in which temporal selection goes awry. In the attentional blink, subjects fail to report the second of a pair of targets (T1 and T2) when they are presented at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of roughly 200 to 500 ms. We directly tested the properties of temporal selection during the blink by analyzing distractor intrusions at a fast rate of item presentation. Our analysis shows that attentional selection is (a) suppressed, (b) delayed, and (c) diffused in time during the attentional blink. These effects are dissociated by their time course: The measure of each effect returns to the baseline value at a different SOA. Our results constrain theories of the attentional blink and indicate that temporal selection varies along at least three dissociable dimensions: efficacy, latency, and precision.},
