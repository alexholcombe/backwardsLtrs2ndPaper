	abstract = {This chapter will provide an overview of serial-attention models of eye-movement control in reading, which share the core assumptions that attention is allocated sequentially to support the lexical processing of only one word at a time, and that lexical processing normally causes the eyes to move from one word to the next. Two such models (Reader: Just and Carpenter, 1980; EMMA: Salvucci, 2001) are briefly described and a third (E-Z Reader: Reichle et al., 1998) is described in detail. The chapter then reviews simulations completed using the E-Z Reader model to evaluate the plausibility and generality of its assumptions, and to examine various reading phenomena. These simulations are consistent with the hypothesis that attention is allocated serially during reading.},
