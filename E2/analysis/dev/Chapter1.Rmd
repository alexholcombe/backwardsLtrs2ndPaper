Optional validation (don't have to run this to go to next step), loads raw data on its own and validates a few things 

1/3 of trials have 1 target (numTargets==1)
targetSide ==0  means targets on both sides 

Checking some stuff out

```{r set up functions}

#Loads raw data from MATLAB files for second backwards paper second experiment
require(R.matlab)

mainPath<-".." # to main E2 folder

#Second experiment of second backwards-letters paper. random orientation each frame.
rawDataPath<- file.path(mainPath,
                            "Data/RawData/Data")
#raw data path containing .mat file for each subject

source(file.path("turnMATintoMeltedDataframe.R"))
cat("Here are the files in the raw data directory")
dir(rawDataPath)
```
